# This is the base class for all the "inspect" plugin classes. It keeps
# track of the loaded subclasses and allows for querying plugins for a
# given scope or all available ones.
#
# The names of the subclasses are 1:1 mappings of the inspection areas, e.g.
# the PackagesInspector class would be used for inspection when the user
# specifies "--scope=packages".
#
# All subclasses have to implement the
#
#   inspect(system, description)
#
# method which inspects the given system and stores the gathered information in
# the description. It returns a brief summary string of the inspection.
#
# The description object can also be used to store files in the description.
