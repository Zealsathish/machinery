module Machinery
  module Errors
    # Superclass for all "expected" errors in Machinery.
    # "Expected" errors are errors which are caused by the environment or input
    # data and are not caused by bugs in the machinery codebase.
    #
    # Those errors will be handled specially by the machinery tool, e.g. by not
    # showing a backtrace.
